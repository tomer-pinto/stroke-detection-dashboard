# Stroke Detection Dashboard ðŸ§ 

This project is an interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit that uses a deep learning model to detect early signs of facial asymmetry associated with a stroke from an image. The application allows users to analyze images either from a file upload or a live camera feed.

This dashboard was developed as a final project for a B.Sc. in Information Systems Engineering, specializing in Data Science.

## Features
* **Live Prediction Tool:** Analyze images from a file upload or live camera feed using a stateful, multi-screen interface.
* **Dual Model Analysis:** Choose between a robust Ensemble model (recommended) or the best-performing single model (ResNet50V2).
* **Comprehensive Model Insights:** A dedicated section with three sub-tabs for a complete performance analysis:
    * **Performance Summary:** High-level KPIs, model score comparisons, and a final recommendation.
    * **In-Depth Comparison:** Side-by-side plots (Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, PR Curve) for the two main models.
    * **Interactive Explorer:** A tool to explore the decision threshold's impact on metrics in real-time.
* **Project Documentation:** Includes detailed sections about the project's goal, methodology, and contact information.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **App Framework:** Streamlit
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Data & Plotting:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Image Processing:** OpenCV, Pillow, Albumentations
